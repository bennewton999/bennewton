# NPM Contact Card

![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bennewton.svg?style=flat-square)

My take on the NPX me contact card.

To run - `npx bennewton`

To make your own, fork this Repo and update the myData.js, add ascii art to asciiArt.js or leave file empty. When updated, publish to npm as your own new package.
